# Assignment 2

This project is the repo for rapid application development at RMIT, assignment 2, undertaken by myself and @fauxtography, Gabriel Haines in 2017 semester 2. The aim of A2 was to make a hacker news styled website where users can post articles, comments, and then have those reflected on the site. It uses ruby on rails, and is setup to deploy to heroku.
